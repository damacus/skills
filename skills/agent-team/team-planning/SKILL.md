# Team Planning

Plan first; do not implement or dispatch a writer from this skill. This workflow prepares a
safe, reviewable execution packet for a later tranche-development run.

## Required context

1. Read the current project's team charter and repository instructions.
2. Read `adaptive-model-routing` completely and use it to choose the smallest capable assistance
   level.
3. Use the durable artifacts, independent-review gates, continuous-execution rule, and final broad
   review defined in this skill. No separate development-workflow skill is required.

The charter is the source of truth for project-specific authority, safety rules, product history,
and local commands. Keep those details out of this portable skill.

## Portable vocabulary

The role names in this skill are portable labels rather than project-specific identities:

- Bucky coordinates, integrates, and owns acceptance.
- Nightingale is the sole writer for an active tranche.
- Hubble performs independent read-only review.
- Scout performs bounded read-only discovery.

Luna, Terra, and Sol are model tiers from `adaptive-model-routing`, not team seats. A project charter
may refine these roles, but it must preserve the one-writer and independent-review boundaries.

Cake is a post-acceptance recognition reward. It is never a task, tranche, scope unit, priority,
approval, performance target, or definition of done. Plans must use ordinary work language.

## Plan artifact

Write a file-based plan that gives each tranche:

- a user-visible outcome and definition of done;
- non-overlapping owned paths and explicitly read-only context;
- constraints, safety boundaries, and escalation conditions;
- exact verification commands and the authoritative environment;
- a uniquely named file brief and report path;
- a ledger entry format and the independent-review gate required before completion.

Keep the plan small enough that one writer can carry the whole tranche through review fixes. Split
only at a real ownership or verification boundary; do not turn tightly coupled work into parallel
writer tasks.

## Assistance gates

Choose assistance before producing the plan. Read-only help must have bounded questions, paths,
and a report artifact.

| Work shape | Planning assistance |
| --- | --- |
| Small, exact, low-risk edit with obvious verification | Bucky plans directly; no assistant is needed. |
| Substantial bounded work with independent discovery or review questions | Use read-only Scout or Hubble assistance, routed to Luna `medium`/`high` when available; fall back to Terra at the same effort when Luna is unavailable. |
| High-risk, cross-cutting, safety-sensitive, ambiguous, or repeatedly failing work | Keep judgment with Bucky at Sol `high` or higher; use read-only help only for a sharply bounded evidence question. |

Escalate rather than guess when scope expands, an interface or safety decision appears, evidence
conflicts, or the same verification failure survives two evidence-based attempts.

## Recorded planning routes

When emitting or recording a planning route, list only seats active during planning. Nightingale never
appears in that route, `writer_owner_count` is zero because no active tranche owns writing yet,
and future implementation ownership is not part of a planning decision. Sol `high` and `xhigh`
routes have `fallback: null` while Sol is
available. Luna-to-Terra fallback applies only when Luna is the chosen primary and Luna is
unavailable.

## Planning boundaries

- Never dispatch Nightingale or any other writer while planning.
- Hubble and Scout remain read-only. Their reports inform Bucky's decisions but do not change the
  plan without Bucky's review.
- Do not promise commits, pushes, upstream mutation, or product-scope expansion without the
  authority required by the project charter and repository instructions.
- Preserve existing work, use isolated workspaces and databases when the charter requires them,
  and keep all records truthful.

## Handoff to execution

Before handing a plan to tranche development, confirm that it preserves the durable workflow:
file-based briefs and reports, a progress ledger, independent per-task review, continuous execution,
and a final broad review. Record unresolved questions and their owner in the plan; do not conceal
uncertainty in a vague task.
